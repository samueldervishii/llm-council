"""External status prober run from GitHub Actions.

This script is the "observer" in the status tracking system. It runs on
GitHub's infrastructure (not on Render), so it can still record a "down"
sample when the Étude backend is asleep or dead.

Flow:
    1. HTTP GET against /health on the Étude backend.
    2. Categorize the outcome into operational / degraded / down based on
       HTTP status code and whether we got a response at all.
    3. Connect directly to MongoDB Atlas (not through the backend) and
       insert a single document into `service_checks`.

Why not talk to the backend's /status/probe endpoint?
    Because when the backend is down, that POST would also fail and we
    would lose the "down" sample — which is the entire point of having an
    external observer. Direct DB writes are the only way to guarantee the
    sample is recorded.

Environment variables (set as GitHub Actions secrets):
    CORTEX_HEALTH_URL   Full URL to the /health endpoint on Étude API
                        (var name kept as CORTEX_HEALTH_URL because it's
                        already wired up as a GitHub Actions secret)
    MONGODB_URL         mongodb+srv://... connection string for Atlas
    MONGODB_DATABASE    Database name (usually `thesis_db`)
